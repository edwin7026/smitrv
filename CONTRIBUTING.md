Contributing
============

Your inputs are welcomed and greatly appreciated! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Github is preferred mode for collaboration


We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All changes happen through Pull Requests


Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you have updated the docs, ensure that they render correctly in the respective format.
3. Make sure to create an entry in the CHANGELOG.md.
4. Ensure the existing framework is not broken and still passes the basic checks.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Checks for a PR


Make sure your PR meets all the following requirements:

1. You have made an entry in the CHANGELOG.md.
2. The commit messages are verbose.
3. You PR doesn't break existing framework.

Note: You can have either a patch or minor or major update.
Note: In case of a conflict, the maintainers will decide the final version to be assigned.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](<https://github.com/edwin7026/smitrv/issues>)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](<https://github.com/edwin7026/smitrv/issues/new>). It's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code


**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Where to start?
- Why don't you explore the `/docs` directory?
- Check the issues tab. You might be of great help there! :)
