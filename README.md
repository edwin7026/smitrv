# Design of Instruction Fetch Unit 

In this repository, we will design an instruction fetch unit with the help of verilog.




## Deployment

To deploy this project first download the repository and navigate to the folder via VsCode.

Make sure you have Icarus Verilog installed as your verilog simulator.

Open a new terminal and paste the following command
```
iverilog -o simulation InstructionFetchUnit.v InstructionFetchUnit_TestBench.v
```
where simulation is the name of the execution file created by taking InstructionFetchUnit.v and InstructionFetchUnit_TestBench.v as inputs.

After simulation file is created, we enter the following command in the terminal 
```
vvp simulation
```
You will get the output as below:-

![OUTPUT](https://github.com/rebek-007/riscvisa/blob/master/Output.png)

- "Output Instruction: 0": This line indicates that an output instruction value of "0" was observed during the simulation. It means that the instruction fetch process did not successfully load an instruction into the output instruction register (`pOutInstr`).
- "Output Data: 0": This line indicates that an output data value of "0" was observed during the simulation. It means that the data fetch process did not successfully load any data into the output data register (`pOutData`).
- "Output Data: 1": This line indicates that an output data value of "1" was observed during the simulation. It means that the data fetch process successfully loaded data into the output data register (`pOutData`).
- "InstructionFetchUnit_TestBench.v:71: $finish called at 170 (1s)": This line provides information about the simulation termination. It states that the `$finish` system task was called at simulation time 170 (1s). This indicates that the simulation has reached its completion point and is terminating.

We also get the file "simulation.vcd" created in our folder.

To view the output waveform of the said output, we run the following command 

```
gtkwave simulation.vcd 
```
A timing diagram will be generated by `gtkwave` application. We can analyse the output signals as per our requirement.
